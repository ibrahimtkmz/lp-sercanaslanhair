      },
      {
        "question": "Is the hair transplant procedure painful?",
        "answer": "The procedure is performed under local anesthesia, so you won’t feel any pain during the process. Mild discomfort may be experienced afterward, which is manageable with medication."
      },
      {
        "question": "When will I see the final results?",
        "answer": "Initial hair growth starts around 3 to 4 months after the procedure. Full results are usually visible within 9 to 12 months."
      },
      {
        "question": "Will the transplanted hair fall out?",
        "answer": "The transplanted hair will initially shed after 2–3 weeks — this is completely normal. The new permanent hair starts growing in the following months."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is the hair transplant permanent?",
        "answer": "Yes, the transplanted hair is taken from the donor area (usually the back of the head), which is genetically resistant to hair loss. The results are permanent."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do you offer accommodation and airport transfers?",
        "answer": "Yes, we provide VIP airport pickup, hotel accommodation, and full travel support for our international patients."

      {
        "question": "Can I go back to work after the procedure?",
